Installing Tomcat
Here are the easy to follow steps to get it up and running on your Mac
Download a binary distribution of the core module: apache-tomcat-7.0.47.tar.gz from here. I picked the tar.gz in Binary Distributions / Core section.
Opening/unarchiving the archive will create a folder structure in your Downloads folder: (btw, this free Unarchiver app is perfect for all kinds of compressed files and superior to the built-in Archive Utility.app)
~/Downloads/apache-tomcat-7.0.47
Open to Terminal app to move the unarchived distribution to /usr/local
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local
sudo mv ~/Downloads/apache-tomcat-7.0.47 /usr/local
To make it easy to replace this release with future releases, we are going to create a symbolic link that we are going to use when referring to Tomcat (after removing the old link, you might have from installing a previous version):
sudo rm -f /Library/Tomcat
sudo ln -s /usr/local/apache-tomcat-7.0.47 /Library/Tomcat
Change ownership of the /Library/Tomcat folder hierarchy:
sudo chown -R <your_username> /Library/Tomcat
Make all scripts executable:
sudo chmod +x /Library/Tomcat/bin/*.sh
